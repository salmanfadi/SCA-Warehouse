# Stock Out Process Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Database Schema Mismatches**
   - Removed references to non-existent columns (`batch_number` and `product_name`) from insert/update operations
   - Preserved these fields inside the JSONB `notes` column for backward compatibility
   - Fixed `stock_out_details` table update to use correct fields (`processed_at` and `processed_by`)
   - Replaced non-existent RPC function call with direct calculation of processed quantities

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Replaced batch number column with barcode in the stock out progress UI
   - Added product name extraction from the `notes` JSON field
   - Improved location display to fall back to multiple sources of location data
   - Fixed remaining quantity calculation to handle missing data

3. **Progress Bar Logic**
   - Corrected progress calculation to properly reflect 0% to 100% progress
   - Added detailed logging of progress calculations
   - Improved documentation to clarify progress calculation logic
   - Fixed synchronous initial progress calculation for UI initialization

4. **Inventory Updates**
   - Replaced references to non-existent `inventory_summary` and `inventory_locations` tables
   - Updated inventory deduction to work directly with `batch_items` table
   - Implemented FIFO (First In, First Out) logic for inventory deductions
   - Added detailed logging for inventory updates

5. **Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive try/catch blocks around database operations
   - Improved error messages with context about the operation being performed
   - Added fallbacks for missing or invalid data
   - Enhanced logging to aid in debugging

## Files Modified

1. **`stockoutService.ts`**
   - Fixed `completeStockOut` function to handle database schema correctly
   - Updated `createProcessedItem` to match actual database schema
   - Fixed `updateInventoryForProducts` to use `batch_items` table
   - Fixed `updateLocationSpecificInventory` to use `batch_items` table
   - Improved `calculateStockOutProgress` and `calculateInitialProgress` functions

2. **`StockOutProgress.tsx`**
   - Updated UI to show barcode instead of batch number
   - Fixed progress bar display
   - Improved data extraction from processed items
   - Enhanced remaining quantity calculation

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**
   - Test the complete stock out workflow end-to-end
   - Verify barcode scanning and validation
   - Check inventory deductions are working correctly
   - Confirm progress calculation is accurate

2. **Potential Improvements**
   - Add unit tests for critical functions
   - Consider adding database migrations for missing tables/columns if needed
   - Improve error handling with user-friendly messages
   - Add transaction support for atomic operations
